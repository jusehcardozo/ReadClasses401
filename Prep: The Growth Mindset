Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

The way to better your skills is not by practicing what you already know and feel confortable doing, but actually doing what you haven't really mastered yet, by doing what makes you get out of your comfort zone.
A few ideas of what is a good practice are:
Pushes you just outside your comfort zone;
Repeated often;
Feedback on results in continuously available;
It's highly demanding mentally;
It's difficult;
It requires good goals.

You need to look for challenges, and the best person to know what challenges you is YOURSELF.
When you find what challenges you, you need to do it repeatedly until you start to feel comfortable enough doing it.
The goals of the challenges should be picked such that achieving them teaches you something new. It doesn't matter a great deal what the end result is, only what you learned on the way.

There was a study that proved that when you hit harder problems to solve, you get improvement in effort, strategies, engagement over longer periods of time and more perseverance.

Another study found that you need the power of passion and perseverance to find "grit" in order to better succeed.
