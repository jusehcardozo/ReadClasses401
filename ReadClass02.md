Goals of a security model

The two primary objectives of information security within the organization from a risk management perspective include:

Have controls in place to support the mission of the organization.
All the decisions should be based on the risk tolerance of the organization.

Strategy leads to tactics, tactics lead to operations

Then, the strategic goals may refer to having all domains centrally administered and implementing VPNs and RADIUS servers to provide a highly secure environment that provides a good amount of assurance to the management and employees.

A security model has different layers, but it also has different types of goals to accomplish in different time frames.

Operational goals: Daily goals, or operational goals, focus on productivity and task-oriented activities to ensure the company’s functionality in a smooth and predictable manner.

Tactical goals: Corresponding mid-term goals, or tactical goals, could involve moving computers into domains, installing firewalls and segregating the network by creating a demilitarized zone

Strategic goals: A long-term goal, or strategic goal, may involve moving all the branches from dedicated communication lines to frame relay, implementing IPSec virtual private networks (VPNs) for all remote users instead of dial-up entry, and integrating wireless technology with the comprehensive security solutions and controls existing within the environment.

Security fundamentals: CIA
Confidentiality, integrity and availability (the CIA triad) is a typical security framework intended to guide policies for information security within an organization.

1. Confidentiality: Prevent unauthorized disclosure
Confidentiality of information refers to protecting the information from disclosure to unauthorized parties.
2. Integrity: Detect modification of information
The integrity of information denotes protecting sensitive information from being modified by unauthorized parties.
3. Availability: Provide timely and reliable access to resources
Availability of information signifies ensuring that all the required or intended parties are able to access the information when needed.

Risk management and the CISSP

Risk management is the process of identifying, examining, measuring, mitigating or transferring risk. Its main goal is to reduce the probability or impact of an identified risk. The risk management lifecycle includes all risk-related actions such as assessment, analysis, mitigation and ongoing risk monitoring, which we will discuss in the latter part of this article.

The success of a security program can be traced to a thorough understanding of risk. Without proper consideration and evaluation of risks, the correct controls may not be implemented. Risk assessment ensures that we identify and evaluate our assets, then identify threats and their corresponding vulnerabilities.

Lifecycle of risk management

Risk assessment: Categorize, classify and evaluate assets, as well as identify threats and vulnerabilities
Risk analysis: Both qualitative and quantitative
Risk mitigation/response: Includes reducing or avoiding risk, transferring risk, and accepting or rejecting risk

1. Risk assessment
Looks at risks corresponding to identified parameters for a specific period and must be reevaluated periodically. Managing risks is an ongoing process.
2. Risk analysis
Risk can be analyzed through a qualitative and quantitative lens.
Qualitative analysis is subjective in nature and uses words like “high,” “medium,” “low” to describe the likelihood and severity of the impact of a threat exposing a vulnerability.
3. Mitigating risk
There are three acceptable responses to risk mitigation:
Reduce
Transfer
Accept
Organizations need to continue to monitor for risks. How an organization decides to mitigate business risks becomes the basis for security governance and policy.
