SOC 2 Compliance

SOC 2 is a voluntary compliance standard for service organizations, developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA), which specifies how organizations should manage customer data. The standard is based on the following Trust Services Criteria: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy. A SOC 2 report is tailored to the unique needs of each organization. Depending on its specific business practices, each organization can design controls that follow one or more principles of trust. These internal reports provide organizations and their regulators, business partners, and suppliers, with important information about how the organization manages its data. There are two types of SOC 2 reports:

Type I describes the organization’s systems and whether the system design complies with the relevant trust principles.
Type II details the operational efficiency of these systems.

Compliance with SOC 2 requirements indicates that an organization maintains a high level of information security. Strict compliance requirements (tested through on-site audits) can help ensure sensitive information is handled responsibly.

SOC audits can only be performed by independent CPAs (Certified Public Accountants) or accounting firms.
AICPA has established professional standards meant to regulate the work of SOC auditors. In addition, certain guidelines related to the planning, execution and oversight of the audit must be followed. All AICPA audits must undergo a peer review.

Customers prefer service providers that are fully compliant with all five SOC 2 principles. This shows that your organization is strongly committed to information security practices.
In addition to the basic security principles, here is how to comply with other SOC 2 principles:
-Availability;
-Processing integrity;
-Confidentiality;
-Privacy.

SOC 1 and SOC 2 are two different compliance standards, with different goals, both regulated by the AICPA. SOC 2 is not an “upgrade” of SOC 1.
